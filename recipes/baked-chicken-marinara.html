    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This baked chicken marinara could not be easier. Seasoned, pan-seared chicken breasts bake in the same skillet with marinara and mozzarella for a cozy, comforting dinner.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce (such as Rao’s®)</li>
        <li>8 ounces low-moisture, part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 2 cups)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup torn fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>cooked pasta, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) with racks in upper and lower third positions.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle both sides of chicken evenly with salt and Italian seasoning. Heat oil in a deep, large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Pour marinara sauce evenly over chicken and sprinkle with mozzarella. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake on the lower third rack in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, the sauce is bubbling around the edges, and a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove skillet from oven and remove foil. Increase oven temperature to broil. Once preheated, return skillet to upper third rack and broil until cheese is lightly browned in spots, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil and serve with pasta.</li>
    </ol>
